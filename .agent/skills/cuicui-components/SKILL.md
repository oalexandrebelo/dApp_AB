# CuiCui - The "Copy UI" Library

> **Official Docs:** [cuicui.day](https://cuicui.day)
> **Style:** Clean, Modern, Polished

CuiCui (pronounced "Kwee-Kwee", like a bird chirp) creates high-quality, lightweight components aimed at improving developer experience (DX).

## 📦 Setup

Standard modern React stack requirements:

```bash
npm install framer-motion tailwind-merge clsx
```

## 🚀 Component Philosophy

CuiCui distinguishes itself by offering:
1.  **Zero-Bloat**: Code is kept minimal.
2.  **Modern**: Uses latest React patterns.
3.  **Collections**: Grouped by specific use-cases.

## 📂 Key Collections

### 1. Application UI
Components for building apps, not just landing pages.
- **Settings Menus**: iOS style lists.
- **Inputs**: Password strength meters, OTP inputs.
- **Color Pickers**: Advanced interaction color selection.

### 2. Marketing UI
- **Pricing Tables**: Clean comparison views.
- **Feature Sections**: Elegant grids with icons.

### 3. Utilities
- **Hooks**: Useful hooks for UI (use-measure, use-mouse).

## 🛠️ Usage Guidelines

1.  **Explore**: Use the beautiful sidebar on `cuicui.day` to find a specific need (e.g., "Hooks" or "Marketing").
2.  **Copy**: The "Copy" button handles imports well.
3.  **Paste**: Place in `components/cuicui` to keep them separate from generic UI.

## 🎨 Best Fit

Use CuiCui when you need **Application building blocks** that look premium.
*   *Example*: A complex settings page.

*   *Example*: Advanced form interactions.
