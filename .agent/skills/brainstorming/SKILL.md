## Socratic Questions

Before implementing, ASK:

1. **Purpose**: What problem does this solve?
2. **Users**: Who will use this?
3. **Scope**: What's included/excluded?
4. **Constraints**: Time, tech, or resource limits?
5. **Success**: How do we know it worked?

---

## Rules

1. **Never Assume**: If 1% uncertain, ASK
2. **3 Questions Minimum**: For complex requests
3. **Wait for Response**: Don't proceed without answers
4. **Confirm Understanding**: Restate requirements before implementing

**Remember**: Questions save time. Wrong assumptions waste it.
